# RateLimiter

A rate limiter is a system designed to control and limit the rate of incoming requests for a service. It acts as a protective layer, preventing excessive usage of the service, whether intentional or unintentional. By enforcing rate limits, rate limiters help maintain system stability, prevent abuse, and ensure fair resource allocation.

## How Rate Limiters Work
Rate limiters typically employ various algorithms to enforce the defined rate limits. One common approach is the sliding window algorithm. It divides time into fixed intervals or windows and keeps track of the number of requests received within each window.

When a request is received, the rate limiter checks if the current rate of requests exceeds the predefined limit. If it does, the request is either denied or delayed until the rate drops below the limit. The sliding window algorithm maintains a sliding time window, continuously updating and shifting the window as time progresses.

## Benefits and Applications
Rate limiters offer several benefits and find applications in a wide range of systems and services:

### Protection against abuse: 
Rate limiters safeguard services from malicious attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and brute-force login attempts. By limiting the number of requests, they prevent overwhelming the system and maintain its availability.

### Fair resource allocation: 
Rate limiters ensure fair resource allocation by preventing any single user or client from monopolizing system resources. They distribute resources among multiple users, maintaining a balanced and equitable service experience.

### Mitigation of server overload: 
During periods of high traffic or sudden spikes in requests, rate limiters help prevent server overload. By controlling the incoming request rate, they allow the server to handle requests within its capacity, avoiding performance degradation or service interruptions.

### API management: 
Rate limiters are commonly used in API management to enforce usage quotas and prevent abuse or excessive consumption of API resources. They enable service providers to control access, manage API usage, and ensure a high-quality experience for all API consumers.

### System optimization: 
Rate limiters can be used to optimize resource usage and prioritize critical processes. By limiting non-essential or resource-intensive operations, they help maintain system stability and allocate resources efficiently.
